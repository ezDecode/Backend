# Phase 1: 
Basic Project Set up
Install all the required packages (express, nodemon)
Then test the Server, weather it's running or not


# Phase 2: 


Created a Middleware Folder and looger.js
then we'll set up a Basic access looger middleware



# Phase 3: 

we'll now setup a user and roles inside the Data folder! Like some data will be added there; so that we can use that Later on

# Phase 4: 

Role Based auth; as we have added some users in the users.js file; using that we are gonna build the whole logic okay




// For the Placement of the Middleware and all;

the errorHandler comes last!
